# Joule Thief Circuit Project

##  Overview

This project demonstrates the design and working of a **Joule Thief circuit**, a simple voltage-boosting circuit that can power an LED using a low-voltage or nearly dead battery. The project includes circuit explanation, simulation, and practical implementation to showcase efficient energy utilization.

##  What is a Joule Thief Circuit?

A Joule Thief circuit is a self-oscillating boost converter that increases low input voltage using a transistor and a toroidal coil with two windings. By rapidly switching the transistor ON and OFF, the circuit stores energy in a magnetic field and releases it as high-voltage pulses, allowing devices like LEDs to operate even from weak batteries.
